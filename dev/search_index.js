All calculations in the Bigleaf.jl package assume that the ecosystem behaves like a  \"big-leaf\", i.e. a single, homogenous plane which acts as the only source and sink of the measured fluxes. This assumption comes with the advantages that calculations are simplified considerably and that (in most cases) little ancillary information on the EC sites is required.
